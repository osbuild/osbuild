    """File System Cache

    This file system cache context represents an on-disk cache. That is, it
    allows storing information on the file system, and retrieving it from other
    contexts.

    A single cache directory can be shared between many processes at the same
    time. The cache protects access to the cached data. The cache must not be
    shared over non-coherent network storage, but is designed for system-local
    linux file-systems.

    The file-system layout is as follows:

        [cache]/
        ├── cache.info
        ├── cache.lock
        ├── cache.size
        ├── objects/
        │   ├── [id0]
        │   ├── [id1]/
        │   │   ├── data/
        │   │   │   └── ...
        │   │   ├── object.info
        │   │   └── object.lock
        │   └── ...
        └── stage/
            ├── uuid-[uuid0]
            ├── uuid-[uuid1]/
            │   ├── data/
            │   │   └── ...
            │   ├── object.info
            │   └── object.lock
            └── ...

    The central data store is in the `objects` subdirectory. Every cache entry
    has a separate subdirectory there. To guard access, a read-lock on
    `object.lock` is required for all readers, a write-lock is required for all
    writers. Static information about the object is available in the
    `object.info` file.

    As an optimization, entries in the object store consisting of a single
    file can be stored directly underneath `objects` without a separate
    subdirectory hierarchy. Their guarding lock is directly taken on this file
    and no metadata is available, other than the file information itself. This
    is used extensively by the cache management to prepare objects for atomic
    replacements. Due to lack of metadata, they are volatile and can be
    deleted as soon as they are unlocked.

    Generally, access to the cache is non-blocking. That is, if a read-lock
    cannot be acquired, an entry is considered non-existant. Thus, unless
    treated as a `write-once` cache, cache efficiency will decrease when taking
    write-locks.

    The `data/` directory contains the content of a cache entry. Its content
    is solely defined by the creator of the entry and the cache makes no
    assumptions about its layout. Note that the `data/` directory itself can be
    modified (e.g., permission-changes) if an unnamed top-level directory is
    desired (e.g., to store a directory tree).

    Additionally to the `objects/` directory, a similar `stage/` directory is
    provided. This directory is `write-only` and used to prepare entries for
    the object store before committing them. The staging area is optional. It
    is completely safe to do the same directly in the object store. However,
    the separation allows putting the staging area on a different file-system
    (e.g., symlinking to a tmpfs), and thus improving performance for larger
    operations. Otherwise, the staging area follows the same rules as the
    object store, except that only writers are expected. Hence, staging entries
    always use a unique UUID as name. To commit a staging entry, a user is
    expected to create an entry in the object store and copy/move the `data/`
    directory over.

    To guard against parallel accesses, a set of locks is utilized. Generally,
    a `*.lock`-file locks the directory it is in, while a lock on any other
    file just locks that file (unfortunately, we cannot acquire write-locks on
    directories directly, since it would require opening them for writing,
    which is not possible on linux). `cache.lock` can be used to guard the
    entire cache. A write-lock will keep any other parallel operation out,
    while a read-lock merely acquires cache access (you are still allowed to
    modify the cache, but need fine-grained locking). Hence, a write-lock on the
    global `cache.lock` file is only required for operations that cannot use
    fine-grained locking. The latter requires individual locking for each file
    or each object store entry you modify. In all those cases you must ensure
    for parallel modifications, since lock acquisition on file-systems can only
    be done after opening a file.

        """Cache Miss Exception

        This error is raised when a cache entry is not found. Due to the
        shared nature of the cache, a caller must be aware that any entry can

        locks the cache-information file, reads it in, updates the newly read
        information with the data from `info`, writes the result back to disk
        and finally unlocks the file.

        There are a few caveats to take into account:

         * The locking guarantees that simultaneous updates will be properly
           ordered and never discard any information.
         * Since this reads in the newest cache-information, this function can
           update cache-information values other than the ones from `info`. Any
           value unset in `info` will be re-read from disk and thus might
           change (in the future, if required, this can be adjusted to allow a
           caller to hook into the operation while the lock is held).
         * You cannot strip known values from the cache-information. Any value
           not present in `info` is left unchanged. You must explicitly set a
           value to its default to reset it.
         * Cache-information fields that are not known to this implementation
           are never exposed to the caller, but are left unchanged on-disk.
           This guarantees that future extensions are left alone and are not
           accidentally stripped.

        The cached information of this instance is updated to reflect the
        changes.

        Create a new entry in the object store containing a copy of the file
        system tree specified as `tree`. This behaves like `store()` but instead
        of providing a context to the caller it will copy the specified tree.

        Similar to `store()`, when the entry is committed it is immediately
        unlocked and released to the cache. This means it might vanish at any
        moment due to a parallel cleanup. Hence, a caller cannot rely on the
        object being available in the cache once this call returns.

        If `tree` points to a file, the file is copied. If it points to a
        directory, the entire directory tree is copied including the root entry
        itself. To copy an entire directory without its root entry, use the
        `path/.` notation. Links are never followed but copied verbatim.
