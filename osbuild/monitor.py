Monitor pipeline activity

The osbuild `Pipeline` class supports monitoring of its activities
by providing a monitor object that implements the `BaseMonitor`
interface. During the execution of the pipeline various functions
are called on the monitor object at certain events. Consult the
`BaseMonitor` class for the description of all available events.
