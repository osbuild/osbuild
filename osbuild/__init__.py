"""OSBuild Module

The `osbuild` module provides access to the internal features of OSBuild. It
provides parsers for the input and output formats of osbuild, access to shared
infrastructure of osbuild stages, as well as a pipeline executor.

The utility module `osbuild.util` provides access to common functionality
independent of osbuild but used across the osbuild codebase.
