"""Provide access to an image in the host system's container storage.

This stage differs from other sources in that the source checks to see if the
container is available in the host's container storage. This puts a requirement
on the user to ensure that the container is copied into local storage before
trying to build an image. The starts by reading the host's
`/etc/containers/storage.conf` file and then using the config to check if the
container has been imported.

Unlike all other sources, this source relies on external storage not controlled
by osbuild itself.

Buildhost commands used: `skopeo`.
