summary: Assemble a file system tree into a ostree commit
description: |-
  Needs a file system tree that is already conforming to the ostree
  system layout[1], specified via the `tree` input and commits it
  to a repository. The repository must have been created at `/repo`.
  Additional metadata is stored in `/compose.json` which contains
  the commit compose information. This is also returned via the
  metadata API to osbuild.
