description: |-
  The 'keymap' option sets the default console keyboard layout for vconsole.
  Its value is a keymap, such as 'us' or 'de-latin1'.
  Removes any existing /etc/vconsole.conf, then runs `systemd-firstboot` with the
  `--keymap` option, which sets KEYMAP in /etc/vconsole.conf. If `font` is given
  will additionally set the FONT attribute.
  The 'x11-keymap' option configures the X11 keyboard settings. The value of
  the option is a dictionary with keys representing settings which can be
  configured. Currently, only the 'layouts' setting can be configured. Its value
  is a list of strings, representing the specific layouts, which should
  be configured for the X11 keyboard.
  Valid keymaps are generally found in /lib/kbd/keymaps.
