summary: Generates .hmac checksum files
description: "Generates HMAC values for given files and stores them alongside the\
  \ original\nfor later verification.\nThe stage uses the <algorithm>hmac commands\
  \ (e.g. sha512hmac) which use a\nbuilt-in key when none is provided. Future extensions\
  \ of this stage may\nadd a key parameter if and when it becomes a requirement. \n\
  In its current state, the stage can be used to replicate the generation of\nkernel\
  \ hmac files [1] which are used for integrity verification when booting\nin FIPS\
  \ mode.\nNotes:\n  - Requires hmac calc in the build root (libkcapi-hmaccalc)\n\
