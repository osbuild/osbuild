summary: Install the grub2 boot loader for non-UEFI systems or hybrid boot
description: |-
  This stage can be used to generate a grub2 core image and install
  it to the correct location to enable booting of non-UEFI systems,
  i.e. x86 legacy and PPC64LE (Open Firmware).
  On x86, the core image can be installed into the MBR gap or to a
  dedicated BIOS boot partition when the partition label is GTP. On
  ppc64le with Open Firmware a dedicated 'PrEP partition' is used.
  x86 / MBR gap:
      For historic and performance reasons the first partition
      is aligned to a specific sector number (used to be 64,
      now it is 2048), which leaves a gap between it and the MBR,
      where the core image can be embedded in
  x86 / BIOS boot:
      A dedicated partition with a specific GUID[1] is used.
  ppc64le / Open Firmware:
      A dedicated partition with a specified GUID[2] is used.
      On ppc64le with Open Firmware a special partition called
      'PrEP partition' is used the store the grub2 core; the
      firmware looks for this partition and directly loads and
      executes the core form it.
  On x86, a "boot image", aka grub stage 1, is installed into the
  master boot record (MBR) of the partition (even in the case the
  partition layout is GPT). It main purpose is to load the second
  stage (core image). Therefore the location of the core image is
  patched into the boot image.
  On ppc64le, the firmware itself directly loads the complete core
  image and transfers control to it.
