summary: Create directories within the tree or mount.
description: |-
  Can create one or more directories, optionally also the
  intermediate directories. The stage can gracefully handle
  directories that already exist.
  Please note that the stage won't change the mode of existing
  directories. If you want to change the mode of an existing
  directory, you need to use the `org.osbuild.chmod` stage.
  Mode is applied only to newly created directories and umask
  value is taken into account.
  In the initial version of this stage, there was a bug that caused
  the stage to accept relative paths. This behaviour is kept for
  backward compatibility, thus the following paths are equal:
  /path/to/directory
  path/to/directory
  However, using relative paths is strongly discouraged.
