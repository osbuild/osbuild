summary: Configure GRUB2 bootloader and set boot options
description: |-
  Configure the system to use GRUB2 as the bootloader, and set boot options.
  Sets the GRUB2 boot/root filesystem to `rootfs`. If a separated boot
  partition is used it can be specified via `bootfs`. The file-systems
  can be identified either via uuid (`{"uuid": "<uuid>"}`) or label
  (`{"label": "<label>"}`). The kernel boot argument will be composed
  of the root file system id and additional options specified in
  `{kernel_opts}`, if any.
  Configures GRUB2 to boot via the Boot Loader Specification
  (https://systemd.io/BOOT_LOADER_SPECIFICATION), which is the default
  behavior in Fedora 30 and later.
  This stage will overwrite `/etc/default/grub`, `/boot/grub2/grubenv`, and
  `/boot/grub2/grub.cfg`. (Leading directories will be created if not present.)
  If Legacy boot support is requested via `legacy` this stage will also
  overwrite `/boot/grub2/grub.cfg` and will copy the GRUB2 files from the
  buildhost into the target tree:
  * `/usr/share/grub/unicode.pf2`          -> `/boot/grub2/fonts/`
  * `/usr/lib/grub/$platform/*.{mod,lst}` -> `/boot/grub2/$platform/`
    * NOTE: skips `fdt.lst`, which is an empty file
  The $platform variable (default: i386-pc) refers to target platform
  that grub2 is mean to ran on (see grub-install(1)'s `--target`)
  NB: with legacy support enabled, this stage will fail if the buildhost
  doesn't have `/usr/lib/grub/$platform/` and `/usr/share/grub/unicode.pf2`.
  If UEFI support is enabled via `uefi: {"vendor": "<vendor>"}` this stage will
  also write the `grub.cfg` to `boot/efi/EFI/<vendor>/grub.cfg`. EFI binaries
  and accompanying data can be installed from the built root via `uefi.install`.
  Both UEFI and Legacy can be specified at the same time (hybrid boot).
  If `uefi.unified` is specified or hybrid boot is enabled, the main grub config
  will be written to `boot/grub2/grub.cfg` and a redirect config will be placed
  in the EFI directory.
  If the `saved_entry` option is present it will result in an entry in the
  `grubenv` file of the same name. The grub config file contains logic so
  that this variable will be used to select the next boot entry. This will
  also make grub2-reboot and grub2-set-default tools work. It will also
  prevent newly installed non-default kernels (like e.g. the debug kernel)
  to be selected as default. The contents of variable needs to match the
  corresponding loader entry, which currently is a combination of the
  machine id and kernel NVRA, like e.g.:
    `ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff-5.6.6-300.fc32.x86_64`
  If `saved_entry` is set it is advisable to set `config.default` to
  `saved` so that any re-creation of the grub configuration by the
  user will preserve that functionality.
  Support for "greenboot" can be turned on via the `greenboot` option.
  Greenboot is the idea of automatically rolling back bad updates,
  i.e. updates that do not boot successfully. The implementation
  is split between the boot loader and a user space component.
  The latter sets two variables `boot_counter`, which indicates
  the maximum number of boot attempts and `boot_success` which
  tells the boot laoder if a previous boot was successful. The
  bootloader on the other hand will decrement the counter variable
  and reset the success indicator one.
  An implementation of the user space component for rpm-ostree is
  called `greenboot`.
  Support for ignition (https://github.com/coreos/ignition) can be turned
  on via the `ignition` option. If enabled, a 'ignition_firstboot' variable
  will be created, which is meant to be included in the kernel command line.
  The grub.cfg will then contain the necessary code to detect and source
  the '/boot/ignition.firstboot' file and configure said 'ignition_firstboot'
  variable appropriately. See the 'org.osbuild.ignition' stage for more
  information on that file.
