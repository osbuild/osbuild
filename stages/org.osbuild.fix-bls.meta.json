    "Fixes paths in /boot/loader/entries that have incorrect paths for /boot.",
    "This happens because some boot loader config tools (e.g. grub2-mkrelpath)",
    "examine /proc/self/mountinfo to find the \"real\" path to /boot, and find the",
    "path to the osbuild tree - which won't be valid at boot time for this image.",
    "The paths in the Bootloader Specification are relative to the partition",
    "they are located on, i.e. `/boot/loader/...` if `/boot` is on the root",
    "file-system partition. If `/boot` is on a separate partition, the correct",
    "path would be `/loader/.../` The `prefix` can be used to adjust for that.",
    "By default it is `/boot`, i.e. assumes `/boot` is on the root file-system.",
    "This stage reads and (re)writes all .conf files in /boot/loader/entries."
