# OSBuild - Build-Pipelines for Operating System Artifacts

## CHANGES WITH 15:

  * New assembler, `org.osbuild.oci-archive`, that will turn a tree
    into an Open Container Initiative Image compliant archive. These
    can be used to run containers via e.g. podman.

  * Support for client side certificates to download content from the
    Red Hat servers: the `org.osbuild.files` source got support for
    reading entitlements and pass those certificates along when doing
    requests to fetch the files, i.e. RPMs.

  * A new ManifestPreProcessor (MPP) was added as a new tool, located
    in `tools/mpp-depsolve.py`. Currently, it can take an existing
    manifest and dep-solve packages specified via a new  `mpp-depsolve`
    options in existing `org.osbuild.rpm` stages.
    This is now used to generate Fedora 32 based test pipelines.

  * The `org.osbuild.ostree.commit` assembler gained to option to produce
    a tarball archive instead of the emitting the plain OSTree repository.

  * Schema validation is now done with the draft 4 validator, and works
    therefore with pyhthon-jsonschema 2.6.

  * The `tree_id` and `outpud_id` fields got drop from when inspecting
    pipelines via `osbuild --inspect`.

  * The `--build-env` option has been dropped from the command line
    interface. It was deprecated and not used anymore.

  * Tests have been converted to not rely on `tree_id` and `output_id`
    anymore, as they are deprecated and will be removed in the future.

  * Lots of other improvements to the test infrastructure and the CI.

  * And finally for something meta: this file has been re-formatted to be
    proper markdown.

## CHANGES WITH 14:

  * Schema validation: The osbuild python library gained support for
    retrieving the metadata of modules and schema validation. This is
    being used on each invocation of osbuild in order to validate the
    manifest. Should the validation fail the build is aborted and
    validation errors are returned, either in human readable form or
    in JSON, if `--json` was specified.

  * A `--inspect` command line option was added for osbuild. Instead
    of attempting to build the pipeline, the manifest will be printed
    to stdout in JSON form, including all the calulcated identifiers
    of stages, the assembler and the `tree_id` and `output_id` of the
    pipeline (and build pipelines). Schema validation will be done and
    errors will be reported.

  * Internally, the buildroot class now uses `PYTHONPATH` to point to
    the `osbuild` module instead of the symlinks or bind-mounts in the
    individual modules.

  * Fixes to the CI and many cleanups to the schemata, sample and test
    pipelines as a result of the schema validation work.

## CHANGES WITH 13:

  * Stage `org.osbuild.yum` has been dropped. It has been deprecated for
    some time and `org.osbuild.rpm` provides a better alternative.

  * XZ compression now utilizes all available CPU cores. This affects all
    stages and assemblers that support XZ compression. It should decrease
    compression times considerably.

  * `org.osbuild.grub2` now supports referring to file-systems via a label
    additionally to a UUID. This affects all places where an existing
    file-system is referred to. Disk creation still requires a UUID to be
    provided. `org.osbuild.fstab` gained similar support.

  * RHEL-8.3 is now supported as host system.

  * The 'libdir' layout in `/usr/lib/osbuild/` has been simplified.
    Distributions are no longer required to create mount anchors during
    installation. Instead, all modules (stages, assemblers, sources, and
    runners) can be copied verbatim from the source tree.

  * `org.osbuild.grub2` now correctly pads `grubenv` files to 1024 bytes.
    This was not done correctly, previously, and caused other parsers to
    fail.

  * The containerization via systemd-nspawn was adjusted to support
    running in a container. With sufficient privileges, you can now run
    osbuild pipelines from within a container.

## CHANGES WITH 12:

  * The `qemu` assembler now supports the `VHDX` image format. This is the
    preferred format for AWS targets, so it is a natural fit for our
    assemblers.

  * The `grub2` stage now disables the legacy compatibility by default.
    You have to explicitly enable it in the stage options if you require
    it.

  * Additionally, the `grub2` stage now also has a `uefi.install` option
    to control whether it installs the UEFI configuration from the build
    tree into the target tree. Furthermore, a new option called
  `write_defaults` controls whether default options are written to
  `/etc` (enabled by default).

  * The `dnf` stage was removed. The `rpm` stage fully replaces all its
    functionality.

  * The `fedora27` runner is no longer supported. Fedora 30 is the minimum
    required host version for Fedora systems.

  * Add OSTree integration. This includes multiple stages and sources
    which allow to export osbuild trees as ostree commits, or import
    ostree commits into an osbuild pipeline:

    * org.osbuild.rpm-ostree: This stage uses `rpm-ostree compose` to
                              post-process a tree and prepare it for
                              committing to ostree.

    * org.osbuild.ostree.commit: A new assembler that takes a tree that
                                 conforms to the ostree layout and
                                 turns it into an ostree commit.

    * org.osbuild.ostree: A new source that provides external ostree
                          commits to a pipeline.

    * org.osbuild.ostree: A new stage that takes an ostree commit and
                          prepares the working directory with its
                          content.

  * The `osbuild` binary now has an `--output-directory=DIR` argument
    which allows to specify a directory where to put the output of the
    pipeline assembler. This is optional for now, but will be made
    mandatory in the future.

  * A new stage called `org.osbuild.first-boot` allows to control the
    execution of scripts at the first bootup of the generated images.

## CHANGES WITH 11:

  * Drop support for legacy input: passing in non-manifest style
    pipelines is now not supported anymore.

  * Support for specifying an UUID for partitions when using the GPT
    partition layout was added to the org.osbuild.qemu assembler.

  * Fix a crash in the case the assembler failed, which was caused by
    cleanup up the object while the object was still being written to.

  * Delay the cleanup of the build tree to after the error checking
    since in the error case there is nothing to clean up and trying
    to do so will lead to crash.

  * `objectstore.Object` now directly cleans its working tree up, in
    contrast to relying on the implicit cleanup of `TemporaryDirectory`.
    One advantage of this is that the custom cleanup code can handle
    immutable directories, which Python 3 fails to clean up.

  * Drop custom `os-release` creation from the RHEL 8.2 runner. The
    issue that made this neccessary got fixed upstream.

  * Ensure the build tree is always being built even if there are no
    stages specified.

  * spec file: Do no generate dependencies for the internal files and
    add NEWS.md to the documentation section.

  * The Fedora 30 based aarch64 example was fixed and now builds again.

## CHANGES WITH 10:

  * A new man-page `osbuild-manifest(5)` is available, which describes
    the input format of the JSON manifest that `osbuild` expects.

  * Man-pages can now be built via `make man`. This supports `SRCDIR` and
  `BUILDDIR` variables to build out-of-tree.

  * Temporary objects in the object-store are now created in
  `.osbuild/tmp/`, rather than in the top-level directory. This should
    help cleaning up temporary objects after a crash. If no osbuild
    process is running, the `tmp/` subdirectory should not exist.

  * The final stage of a build-pipeline is no longer automatically
    committed. You must pass checkpoints via `--checkpoint` to commit
    anything to the store.

  * Improve curl timeout handling. This should improve osbuild behavior
    with slow or bad mirrors and make sure operations are retried
    correctly, or time-out if no progress is made.

## CHANGES WITH 9:

  * The last pipeline stage is no longer automatically committed to the
    store. This used to be a special case to make things work, but it has
    now been properly fixed.
    From now on, if you want a stage committed to the store, you need to
    pass a `--checkpoint` option for the stage.

  * The runner for the host system is now auto-detected. The
  `runners/org.osbuild.default` symlink is now longer required (nor
    supported).

  * A generic runner named `org.osbuild.linux` was added. This runner
    uses the default value of `ID` in `/etc/os-release`. That is, if the
    local OS cannot be detected, or if no `os-release` file is provided,
    this is the fallback runner that is used.
    This runner only performs the bare minimum of initialization. It is
    enough to run the most basic stages on all systems we tested.

  * On Archlinux, the generic runner will now be used.

  * A new runner for RHEL-8.1 is available.

  * The JSON input to `osbuild` is now a monolithic manifest format which
    contains all build information. For now, this means the input
    manifest can contain a `pipeline:` key with the pipeline definition,
    as well as a `sources:` key with external source definitions
    previously passed via `--sources`.
    The old input format is still supported, but will be dropped in the
    next release.

  * The osbuild sources now come with a man-page `osbuild(1)`. Further
    pages will follow in the future.
